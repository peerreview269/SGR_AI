training,q1nc1.txt,g,right that's finish point so,explain
training,q1nc1.txt,g,so i take it that must be another they must be between each other,explain
training,q1nc1.txt,g,the line should be between that then,instruct
training,q1nc1.txt,f,between the golf course and the nuclear test site,check
training,q1nc1.txt,g,it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument,check
