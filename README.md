# Coding Small Group Communication: Transformer and RNN Models with Context

This repository provides instructions and scripts for reproducing RNN and Transformer models with context using the Silicone datasets. The project aims to facilitate the coding of small group communication dynamics.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Pytorch
- Transformers
- sk-learn
- Datasets

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch transformers scikit-learn datasets
